Working on a python web app I got really tired of slogging through the command line every time to activate the virtual environement and starting the server.  Trying to automate the process using a batch file wasn't working, the file would run and autoclose.  All the stackoverflow recommendations suggested using the PAUSE command, which didn't work.  For some reason, in my specific environement, when using the "&" rather than a return command caused it to work.
